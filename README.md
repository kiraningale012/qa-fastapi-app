# 🧠 Question Answering System (FastAPI + Transformers)

This project is a **Question Answering Web App** built with **FastAPI** and **Hugging Face Transformers**. It allows users to input a paragraph of context and ask natural language questions. The system responds with detailed, human-like answers using a pretrained language model like `google/flan-t5-large`.
