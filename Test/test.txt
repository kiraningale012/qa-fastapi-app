Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn 
from and make decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, ML algorithms 
use patterns and inference to improve over time. Common types of machine learning include supervised learning, 
where the model is trained on labeled data; unsupervised learning, which finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data; 
and reinforcement learning, where an agent learns to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties. ML is widely 
used in applications like recommendation systems, fraud detection, image recognition, and predictive analytics.
